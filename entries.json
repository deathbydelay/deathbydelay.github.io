      "body": "When I first discovered something was going on we were on a mini vacation and at first it seemed like it was an ingrown hair or something that would resolve itself. Years passed and it grew in size and eventually sometimes started to bleed. I would stop the bleeding, and clean it up and it would be good until next time.\n\nDuring this period it was increasingly annoying when people asked questions about what was on my face, so I grew a beard. It was a success because the questions stopped."

      "body": "In the early part of the month, I noticed something new. It was a lump on my neck near where the thing on my face was. At first the new thing was just a tiny lump, so I kept up with it. I discovered that if I pushed on it I would get a bit light headed. After a week of it growing in size and becoming more firm, I alerted my wife. We made an appointment with our primary who examined and sent referrals for us to see a specialist."

      "body": "My Primary sent us to a dermatologist who immediately identified it as skin cancer, but wasn’t sure if it was a Basal Cell Carcinoma or a Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Regardless, he was doing a biopsy of the thing on my cheek that day. With a scalpel he took a chunk of it out and sent it off to a lab.\n\nWe were also sent to an ENT, and the following monday we met him where he also did a biopsy, but it was on the new lump on my neck. In that office as the second biopsy was being done a flood of emotions washed over me as I realized how much i’d fucked up.\n\nFollowing the Biopsies, the whole area between the old thing and the new thing was incredibly pissed off. The old thing had never presented with pain, it would just bleed sometimes, and the new thing didn’t hurt until I pushed on it too hard. But now they were both angry and causing pain.\n\nMy ENT sent me for a CT Scan of the neck and face. I also was scheduled for what was called a Mohs procedure, which as it was described by the dermatologist was a procedure where they shaved off layers of tissue and checked them to see if they needed to take more skin tissue. The night before I shaved off my beard, the beard I'd had for years as my social protection. It felt like I lost a part of my identity because it was a magnificent beard. We never had that procedure done because when they saw how big the lesion on my face was and learned that there was a lump they cancelled the procedure.\n\nWe saw my ENT the following Tuesday and he was not surprised they refused to do the procedure. We still didn’t know exactly what it was because what I was being told is that a Basal Cell Carcinoma doesn’t really spread like that. My ENT was really aggressive at figuring out what it was and scheduled me for a PET scan, a CT with and without contrast, an MRI with and without contrast, and more labwork. Before I could get them though, I had to endure having all those tests declined by my medical insurance. And I swear I heard the lady on the phone chuckle as she was telling me they were declined. Apparently, this is a normal thing because I alerted my ENTs office and they submitted some additional paperwork or my ENT talked to them on the phone or something else because the tests were then approved.\n\nThe week of the tests was rough because getting all those tests done in such a short span is taxing mentally."

      "body": "We saw my ENT that following Monday for results and he still wasn’t really calling the new lump by a specific name and was being intentionally vague. It didn’t really matter if it had a name because it was getting evicted anyway. However, it needed a name, so I figured that since nearly every Steve I've ever encountered has been a giant douche canoe, I would just name it Steve.\n\nThe first half of November was rather uneventful with most of it being back and forth between the ENT and the plastic surgeon to hammer out the date for surgery. We registered for surgery on my birthday and the surgery was shortly after. The surgery was scheduled to be my ENTs last case for the day so he could spend time getting everything out without feeling rushed. Surgery started around 1p and it was odd because usually the anesthesiologist tells you to count backwards from or towards 10 and only lets you get a couple numbers, but this time i made it all the way to 10. The next thing I remember is waking up in my hospital room and asking for my wife. Some time had passed after I woke up and they finally had contacted her to let her know where I was. She saw me and ran towards the bed and got in it with me and was nearly in hysterics. I had no idea how long the surgery was or even what time it was, but having her was the best part. Well until we set off the bed alarm because I'd gained weight all of a sudden from her sitting in the bed with me. The nurses all rushed in confused and saw what was happening and turned the bed alarm off. I was in excruciating pain and was told they didn’t have any orders for medicine for me.\n\nI’m going to back up a bit, because from my wife’s perspective it’s a bit different. They took me for surgery and had her hang out in the waiting area and after 5 hours my ENT went to talk to her to let her know that his part was finished and that the plastic surgeon was closing me up. Once the plastic surgeon was done he found her as well and brought a picture to her to show how extensive it was. So for my wife it was quite scary because it was taking a lot longer than she thought, but neither of us really knew how long it was supposed to take.\n\nThat basically catches us up from my account and her account, so after she got off my bed and was making sure i was good. She called my ENT to let him know that there were no orders for me and that I was starting to hurt a lot. He called the nurses desk and chewed them out because he’d put the orders in before surgery because he knew what i was going to go through. They find the orders and then start bringing in meds for me and the morphine helps at first but it’s effects are gone within the hour. I mention this to my wife and she gets the nurse and i get more morphine, which again wears off after an hour.\n\nI had my wife take a picture of my face and once i wasn’t as loopy i was able to count that there were 50-60 stitches from what i could see."
