        If you've landed here, it's probably because I pointed you at a QR code or shared a link with you or someone you know. That's intentional. It's a long story and sometimes I get busy and can't tell the story as it deserves. There is also the option that maybe I'm just not in the mood because there are only so many times a person can tell the same story, and I'd rather you have the full picture than a fragmented version delivered on a rough day.

        This page is a living document. I update it when things change. What you read here is as accurate as I can make it at the time of writing. If you have questions after reading, I'm happy to talk — but at least we'll be starting from the same place.
